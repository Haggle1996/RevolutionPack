      <description>Getting the most out of REVOLUTION|3 This brief guide covers some important tips for to get your started with REVOLUTION|3, including a guide to your first few days, maximizing gameplay performance, and running REVOLUTION|3 on a server.
Realistic Terrain Generation (RTG) Make sure to select &amp;lsquo;Realistic&amp;rsquo; world type when creating a world. Server operations will use RTG in the server.properties file. For single-player, I also recommend enabling cheats &amp;ndash; just in case &amp;ndash; but if you&amp;rsquo;re the kind that&amp;rsquo;s susceptible to temptation, you can leave it off.</description>

      <description>Hi all!

      <description>Hi all!
Small update to address the TPS and FPS issues, as well as make oceans and rivers melt!
Pack Changes  Players upgrading maps should receive a message about missing blocks. This is expected and okay to proceed. Ice should now immediately melt, instead of never melting &amp;ndash; seasons should function much better now! Lowered the MCA villager cap to 12 Removed Zombie Awareness and Special AI until I can find a more TPS-friendly means of killing you.</description>

      <description>Hi all!
Welcome to the latest update for REVOLUTON|3. Today&amp;rsquo;s update brings a bunch of mod updates to the pack. Enjoy!
Pack Changes  Players upgrading 3.5.0 maps should receive a message about missing blocks. This is expected and okay to proceed. You may need to do a /bq_admin reset all &amp;lt;username&amp;gt; to address issues with the uncraftable weapon quest. You will need cheats enabled and you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to edit your progress.</description>

      <description>Hi all!
Welcome to the long-awaited big update to REVOLUTION|3. Version 3.5 brings together a number of changes introduced in the community update. Many thanks to gwydion for picking up the pack in my absence. Much of what you have here comes from gwydion&amp;rsquo;s and others hard work!
You&amp;rsquo;ll notice there&amp;rsquo;s a slew of new mods: Blood Magic, Minecraft Comes Alive, Witchery, plus a couple more Thuamcraft mods.

      <description>Hi all!
My apologies for the small update &amp;ndash; my availability has dropped dramatically and I only have time to push these couple updates.
Pack Changes  Added many more quests, thanks to Eb! For existing worlds, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to do /bq_admin default load to access them. Mobs only grief if they have the right tool (e.g., break blocks if they have a pick). This should slow down the madness.</description>

      <description>Hi all!
Really tiny update here (scripts and configs only &amp;ndash; no mod changes) to address some playability and balance issues.
Pack Changes  Animals will no longer spawn hostile. They will however, try to rip you to shreds in packs if you attack them. Additional changes to prevent souls from attacking you on teleport. Removed grass from from the list of blocks that zombies will dig up. This prevents the holey ground everyone is experiencing.</description>

      <description>Hi all!
Small update here to fixup some bugs and issues discovered since the last update. No mod updates, just a bunch of config fixes and tweaks.
Pack Changes  Made souls more passive &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re basically standing chests until attacked &amp;ndash; due to certain issues with them aggroing upon teleport Unofficially renaming the pack tagline to &amp;lsquo;Fear the Rain&amp;rsquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it as an exercise for the reader to figure out why.</description>

      <description>I tried. I really tried.
I cannot get Epic Siege Mod to balance at harder difficulties, particularly in SMP. The super-speed zombies fly past you before registering on your screen, and it&amp;rsquo;s not fun. So I&amp;rsquo;ve done something a little different.
The surface is now safe. Or so your think.
Underneath you, hordes of zombies and monsters waiting to spew forth from underground caverns and ravines. You need the precious resources deep inside the earth, but watch out&amp;hellip;delving too deep and too greedily can result in your utter destruction!</description>

      <description>Hello everyone! Welcome to the next exciting chapter for REVOLUTION|3!
Today we bid a fond adieu to a mod that&amp;rsquo;s been in the pack since the original version 1 of the first REVOLUTION pack. GalactiCraft has been with us for a long time, and many adventurers have put their own boot print on the moon dust. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re replacing GC and related mods with a new space exploration adventure, Advanced Rocketry.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
Small update to add only the world&amp;rsquo;s most incredible mod ever! Welcome Traincraft to the REVOLUTION! Woot Woot! Be aware, this is an optional mod, so you must select it from the optional mod list (or &amp;lsquo;Select Recommended&amp;rsquo; from the bottom) to add it to REVOLUTION|3.
For those seeking more information about Traincraft, check out these helpful links:
 Traincraft Blog Traincraft Website Traincraft License  Unfortunately, due to Traincraft&amp;rsquo;s license, I cannot include the mod directly in the pack, so you must manually download it during the installation process.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
Long-time, no update. Sadly, I&amp;rsquo;ve been very busy with work and haven&amp;rsquo;t had as much time to update the packs lately. But good news, we have an update! Now that Reika has released v16 of his mods, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the opportunity to update REVOLUTION|3 with the latest mods and changes.
We have some awfully fun stuff for you. Most noticably, we&amp;rsquo;ve replaced Gun Customization and Open Modular Turrets with Techguns.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
Since Haggle1996 will be in the great state of Colorado on Friday, I&amp;rsquo;m releasing this update a bit early. Mostly, it contains a large rebalance to Immersive Engineering. In particular, the Diesel Engine is now a viable alternative to RoC Hydrokinetics or Performance Engines. While the RoC engines are still a bit easier and cheaper to acquire, the diesel engine is a bit easier to automate. We&amp;rsquo;ve also significantly buffed the output of coal coke and steel, so you no longer sitting around watching the butterflies roam while waiting for common steel to output.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
Have we got a big surprise for you! And by big, I mean big&amp;hellip;with teeth&amp;hellip;and claws! That&amp;rsquo;s right, Fossils and Archeology has found it&amp;rsquo;s way into REVOLUTION|3, finally completing the circle and allowing you to raise a colony of T-Rexs on Barnard&amp;rsquo;s Star. For what other purpose could an interstellar expedition be undertaken in the first place? Expensive Space Program? Check. Barnard&amp;rsquo;s Star? Check. Dinosaurs repopulated? Check and double-check!</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
Welcome to the inaugural release of REVOLUTION|3, Fear The Moon! REV|3 features some awesome new changes and mechanics&amp;hellip;so many, I don&amp;rsquo;t know where to begin!
First up, we&amp;rsquo;ve removed Better Sleeping &amp;ndash; you still can&amp;rsquo;t sleep through the night, but you no longer need to sleep to regain energy. Coupled with this, we&amp;rsquo;ve swapped out Zombie Awareness, Special AI, and Blood Moons for the Epic Siege Mod. In addition to adding harder mobs and bosses, ESM introduces a blood moon-like event every 8 Minecraft days, during the full moon.</description>
