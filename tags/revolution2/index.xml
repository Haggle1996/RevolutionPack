      <description>Hi all!
Just a tiny update here to resolve a couple of late-breaking issues with 2.7.3.0.
Pack Changes  Disabled the Extra Utilities Ender Collector due to a duplication bug Fixed a problem with the installer that would cause two versions of regular Unity to be installed, instead of Unity and Unity for RotaryCraft. If you want to use the full Unity suite, you should have Unity for RotaryCraft listed first, then Unity 1.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
Much rebalancing and fixes here! While we haven&amp;rsquo;t added any new mods, per se, we&amp;rsquo;ve changed the progression for RF Tools such that you can get into it much sooner in the mid-game. This gives you access to RF Tools awesome inventory machines, screens, and redstone blocks. Dimensions no longer require an owner dimlet, so you can get started exploring dimensions as soon as you produce enough power to keep them going (server admins may want to disable this, at their discretion).</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
There is absolutely nothing to see here in this update. Not a thing&amp;hellip;except of course for DRACONIC EVOLUTION! Whee!
But HAGGLE! How could you put such OPness into REV|2? HOW COULD YOU!?!?
Simple, I say. Make it a worthy reward of being already OP. First, you&amp;rsquo;re going to need some Terrasteel from Botania. Certainly not the end of the world, but it&amp;rsquo;s a start. Add into that Bedrock (RotaryCraft) and Bedrockium (Extra Utilities) ingots, forged from the densest materials in the world.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
Welcome to the next exciting release of REVOLUTION|2! Today&amp;rsquo;s update mostly addresses the SMP crash issue with v13 of Reika&amp;rsquo;s mods and Ender IO, while adding a few convenience of life additions, including Crafting Tweaks! Yay!
Volcanoes have also been re-enabled in world gen, now that RTG finally supports it. Also, Practical Logistics crashes have been addressed. It&amp;rsquo;s a great mod to try!
Pack Changes  Increased frequency of ReactorCraft ores in the Cave dimension.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
Double update today! Yay! With v13 of Reika&amp;rsquo;s mods going into both packs! This changelog is primarily for REVOLUTION|2; the REVOLUTION|1 changelog can be found on the ATLauncher page in the typical place.
Pack Changes  More villagers (including alien villagers) shed emeralds to slightly increase the availability of emeralds pre-mining world. Reenabled naturally-spawning Ore Flowers for all mod ores now that memory issues have been addressed &amp;ndash; this does not retrogen flowers, but new chunks will feature them.</description>

      <description>Holy Crap!
Haggle doesn&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;lsquo;Holy Crap!&amp;rsquo; very often, but when he does, there&amp;rsquo;s a good reason for it.
And HOLY CRAP!
Draco18s has, after a very long, hard slog, figured out the memory leak that has plagued REVOLUTION|2 since the first alpha days. The pack no longer leaks a significant amount of memory during chunk generation, so you should be able to explore without crashing or massive lag. Also, this means pregeneration options for server admins and industrious players now work quite well.</description>

      <description>Hello, everyone! Welcome to the next update of REVOLUTION|2, The Quest for More Money!
Sorry, needless Spaceballs reference&amp;hellip;but moving along. Version 2.5.2.0 is another maintenance update, fixing a number of reported issues as well as rebalancing a few parts of the mod pack. In particular, Forestry is easier to start early-game, and zombie griefing power was lowered a tad. AE2 Stuff is once again working and you&amp;rsquo;ll no longer have to worry about those pesky Natura trees clogging up your Woodcutter farm.</description>

      <description>Good day everyone, Haggle here!
We have a big update in store for you today, but no worries, it&amp;rsquo;s BACKWARDS compatible! Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s right, it will work just fine with version 2.5.0.0 maps!
We&amp;rsquo;ve updated a number of mods, including finally moving AE2 to RV3. We&amp;rsquo;ve also fixed some of the most annoying bugs, including super speed zombies and uncraftable apiarist&amp;rsquo;s chests. We&amp;rsquo;ve also buffed ore output! (yay!)
In addition, we&amp;rsquo;ve added Binnie&amp;rsquo;s mods back into the game, so you have another alternative for ore generation.</description>

      <description>Hi all! Long time, no see!
My apologies for the absence, but real life comes before gaming, and life is very busy right now at the Haggle household. Many thanks to my helpers and players who&amp;rsquo;ve kept the show running in my absence.
We have another exciting update for you, though this one has a bit of an unpleasant surprise for some. Unfortunately, updates to several core mods (particularly v12) have rendered old saves un-upgradeable.</description>

      <description>Good evening, everyone! Welcome to another REVOLUTION|2 update!
In this update, lots of fixes to physics and many bugs squashed like the little creepy things they are! Generally, all RotaryCraft, ElectriCraft, ReactorCraft, and ChromatiCraft blocks (including pipes), are no longer subject to physics. A number of other mods were also fixed in the pass. And we tested it thoroughly this time. Yay!
Additionally, we have a new update to RTG.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
Welcome to another fantastic release of REVOLUTION|2! This week&amp;rsquo;s update focuses mostly on integrating the latest and greatest v11 of Reika&amp;rsquo;s mods, which includes MANY fixes to known bugs and issues. Hooray for bugfixes and a BIG thanks to Reika for all his hard work!
There&amp;rsquo;s also been a huge pass on block physics. A lot more things won&amp;rsquo;t fall anymore. Yay! We&amp;rsquo;ve also managed to make the Rod of the Plentiful Mantle show all the ore again.</description>

Welcome to another exciting release of REVOLUTION|2! We&amp;rsquo;ve got lots in store for you this update, including new mods, squashed bugs, and another chapter in the HQM book! Wheeeeee! You can&amp;rsquo;t contain the updates!
First up, we have an update to Realistic Terrain Generation, which will cause some unsightly chunk border issues when generating new chunks on an existing map. Other than aesthetics, worlds created with earlier versions of RTG are fully compatible with the new version.</description>

      <description>Hello, everyone!
Welcome to REVOLUTION|2 Beta 2.1.3.0 &amp;ndash; the &amp;lsquo;Crusher&amp;rsquo; Update!
After a solid week of playtesting, we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a lot of good feedback, and this update is chock full o&amp;rsquo; quality of life updates. In particular, we&amp;rsquo;ve switched from a blacklist approach to physics, to a whitelist approach. What this means is fewer blocks will fall unexpectedly. We&amp;rsquo;ve also increased the default strength of most blocks. In exchange, we&amp;rsquo;ve turned on slide physics.</description>

      <description>Hello, everyone!
Fingers crossed that this will be the last stability update to REVOLUTION|2 for some time. This update squashes a lot of the outstanding issues with the pack, and in general, you should have a much more reliably-stable experience going forward.
As part of squashing all the instability, we&amp;rsquo;ve had to say a temporary goodbye to Galaxy Space. For one reason or another, it&amp;rsquo;s having identity issues. And as the mod only provides content post-Mars, I thought it safer to just remove it for now.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
My apologies for the daily pack updates, but we&amp;rsquo;re going through a period of very rapid stabilization now that the beta period has started. Keep your fingers crossed that there won&amp;rsquo;t be too many more of these. :)
Server operators be sure to back up your /local folder and restore after the update to retain FTB Utilities settings
Changes  Reduced Blood Moon mob count by 33%, as many servers can&amp;rsquo;t handle the huge number of mob spawns.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
Patch 2.1.0.1 is just a tiny update to fix some various bugs reported today with the pack. No big changes. Move along. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing to see here.
As always, if your HQM quests are reset or otherwise altered, use /hqm edit  (with cheats enabled) to fix your book.
Bugs Squashed  Fixed the trigger quest for HQM Chapter 2, so you no longer need to hold an iron hoe to access them.</description>

      <description>Hello, everyone! Welcome to the REVOLUTION|2 Beta release!
It&amp;rsquo;s been a long, hard month of testing and preparing, but we&amp;rsquo;re finally ready to release the Beta of REVOLUTION|2. We still have more work to do, particularly in the HQM and mod-balance department; however, the pack is stable at this point, and any worlds you create (regardless of world type) should be compatible with new pack updates for a long time to come.</description>

      <description>Hello, everyone! Welcome to another exciting installment of REVOLUTION|2!
Working out a log of the reported bugs this week. I&amp;rsquo;m relatively confident this will be the last alpha (yay!), and that worlds created in the alpha with Biomes O&amp;rsquo; Plenty will be forward compatible with the beta. We&amp;rsquo;re still working out a couple of kinks with Realistic Terrain Generation, but I hope to have that sorted for the beta.</description>

      <description>Hello, Everyone!
WARNING: This alpha is not 100% compatible with previous alpha builds. Expect sudden chunk borders and cut off terrain.
Welcome to what will hopefully be the very last alpha release of REVOLUTION|2. We&amp;rsquo;re still waiting on a couple of mod updates to settle down before we can officially label it a &amp;lsquo;beta&amp;rsquo; release and have stable worlds going forward. That said there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of new content in this pack, including quite a list of new and exciting mods.</description>

      <description>Hello, Everyone!
I was hoping we&amp;rsquo;d have a new release of RTG today, so that I could get the Beta out the door, but it looks like we&amp;rsquo;re still waiting for that to drop. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;m pushing a new release of REVOLUTION|2 Alpha, with various bug fixes and updates.
Changes:  Removed Natura nether trees from eligible list of Dye Tree trunks

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s happening! Revolution|2 Alpha 1 has been pushed to the AT Launcher, and should be appearing soon in your pack list.
