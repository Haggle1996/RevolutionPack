      <description>Alternate Terrain Generator (ATG) or Biomes O&amp;rsquo; Plenty (BoP) When starting a new world, you have a couple of world type options &amp;ndash; either Biomes O&amp;rsquo; Plenty or ATG-Alternate Terrain Generator. I highly recommend changing your world type to ATG &amp;ndash; it generates more realistic rolling hills and surface forms, using the BoP biomes. However, on minimal-memory machines, ATG may cause some hiccups during world generation (there are some workarounds, however).</description>

      <description>Hello everyone!
Double update today! Yay! With v13 of Reika&amp;rsquo;s mods going into both packs! This changelog is primarily for REVOLUTION|2; the REVOLUTION|1 changelog can be found on the ATLauncher page in the typical place.
Pack Changes  More villagers (including alien villagers) shed emeralds to slightly increase the availability of emeralds pre-mining world. Reenabled naturally-spawning Ore Flowers for all mod ores now that memory issues have been addressed &amp;ndash; this does not retrogen flowers, but new chunks will feature them.</description>
