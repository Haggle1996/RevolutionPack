#ATLauncher Pack Code: RevolutionPack

## Revolution Pack

Can you rebuild civilization after the Revolution?

Over 500 years have passed since a nuclear holocaust has devastated the earth. While the earth has recovered, much that survived isn't the earth or inhabitants that we remember. You and your team, kept safe in cryogenic suspension, have been awakened to rebuild civilization!

The Revolution Pack is Minecraft modpack by Haggle1996 which showcases a number of outstanding and new mods from the modding community. Built around the three pillars of design, tech, and magic, this pack brings them all together into a cohesive world that feels so much more alive than a typical kitchen-sink style modpack. Revolution's optional achievement system, combined with it's progressive tech-tree, encourage you to wander through mods you've never seen before or take alternative paths through old-familiars -- or just play it for fun! 

The Revolution Pack is a difficul pack inspired loosely by the progression of hardcore GregTech packs. You'll need to move through RotaryCraft and RailCraft to unlock the full breadth of tech mods. But don't let that discourage you -- The achievement book will guide you through the progression and introduces you to new mods along the way. Plus, Revolution features an array of decorative and atmospheric mods, like DecoCraft, Streams, ATG, Apple & Milk & Tea, BiblioCraft, Storage Drawers, Chisel 2, Big Trees, Plant Mega Pack, Grimoire of Gaia and many, many more. 

Some notable features are:
- Something for everyone: magic, tech, monsters, and decorations
- Gated progression into advanced mods through RotaryCraft and RailCraft
- Unique world generation through ATG, BoP, Streams, Rogue-like dungeons, ChromatiCraft, and Grimoire of Gaia
- A large selection of decorative and game-enriching mods, like DecoCraft, Plant Mega Pack, Garden Stuff, Apple & Milk & Tea, and so many more
- Magical mods that don't break balance - ChromatiCraft, Thaumcraft, and Botania.
- Overhauled ore generation to make mining more exploratory and less grindy. Not every chunk will have iron in it -- but once you find a vein, you'll have enough for your next round of machinery
- Automated ore generation in mid-game (Bees)
- Hunger changes and new flora encourage you to discover new and old ways to feed yourself
- Several sorting systems (Logistics Pipes, Applied Energistics, Refined Relocation, etc.) appeal to any skill level (or inclination)
- Lore and achievements - the in-game achievement book will guide you through the pack and lore, but are completely optional.
- Difficult: challenging, but neither grindy nor excessively difficult. 
- Encourages movement through ancilliary mods
