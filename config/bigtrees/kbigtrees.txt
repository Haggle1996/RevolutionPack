Big Trees Mod Configuration File
----------------------------------------------------
This file must be present in the folder ".minecraft" to take effect.

ALL POSSIBLE OPTION COMBINATIONS ARE PRESENT IN THIS FILE. Don't bother trying options from one section in another section. It won't work. :)

Handy reference information:

Tree (block type 17) Meta Data
  0 = regular
  1 = conifer
  2 = birch

Leaf (block type 18) Meta Data
  0 = regular
  1 = conifer
  2 = birch
  3 = jungle
  4 = regular, never decay
  5 = conifer, never decay
  6 = birch, never decay
  7 = jungle, never decay

My mod reads this file by searching for the keyword "SECTION" followed by a section name, then in that section pulling out options followed by an equals sign then a value. Everything that does not follow such a format is ignored. Percent symbols are for your convenience and don't affect the way the mod interprets a value.

To completely disable big trees tree generation (except when manually grown), set "natural-generation" to false and "natural-generation-exceptions" to none.
To disable all other changes to world generation, set "classic-tree-heights" to true and set "classic-jungle" to true.

----------------------------------------------------
SECTION GENERAL
----------------------------------------------------

The following options mean "do not naturally generate big trees by default
but do generate them in dimension 0"
  natural-generation = false
  natural-generation-exceptions = 0
The following options mean "do allow manual big tree growth (from saplings)
in all dimensions"
  manual-generation = true
  manual-generation-exceptions = none
If, for example, you wanted to not allow manual big tree growth in the
nether and some dimension 2, you could put:
//  manual-generation = true
//  manual-generation-exceptions = -1, 2
Or if you ONLY want players to be able to grow big trees in the normal
dimension, you would put:
//  manual-generation = false
//  manual-generation-exceptions = 0

Do you want to use the default heights for vanilla Minecraft trees?
  classic-tree-heights = false
Do you want the classic Minecraft jungle instead of my modified jungle trees with longer branches?
  classic-jungle = false

LEAF RADIUS
  //0 = no leaves
  //A radius of 1, 2, or 3 grows non-intrusively. (They won't grow through walls and such.)

WARNING: Setting sub branch size to 100 and sub branch section to 100 could easily lock up the computer trying to draw an infinite number of branches! (Setting sub branch size to >100 is bad as well...)
