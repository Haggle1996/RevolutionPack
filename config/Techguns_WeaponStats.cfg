# Techguns Weapon Stats configuration.
# 
# DON'T REMOVE ENTRIES IT WILL CRASH MINECRAFT ON LOADING!
# 
# Variable names are generated from the unlocalized name of the guns.
# 
# NOT EVERY STAT HAS AN EFFECT ON EVERY GUN!
# Numbers like '0.05000000074505806' instead of '0.5' are because of data type rounding. The config file only supports double, while ingame its stored as float.
# 
# Difficult gun names:
# m4_uq is 'The Infiltrator'
# mibGun is 'De-Atomizer Pistol'
# thompson is 'Submachine Gun'
# ak47 is 'Kalashnikov'
# 
# You can regenerate this file by deleting it and launching minecraft.
