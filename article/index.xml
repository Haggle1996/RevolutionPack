      <description>REVOLUTION|3 is a significant update to the original Revolution; please refer to NEI for recipe changes and don&amp;rsquo;t expect everything to work the same as it did in the original Revolution.
Where can I find ore X? Oregen is significantly different. Generally, ores can be found at most y-levels. Many ores spawn with giant, rare motherlodes and long, thin trace veins that lead to these motherlodes. Some ores generate in vertical pipes.</description>

      <description>Getting the most out of REVOLUTION|3 This brief guide covers some important tips for to get your started with REVOLUTION|3, including a guide to your first few days, maximizing gameplay performance, and running REVOLUTION|3 on a server.
Realistic Terrain Generation (RTG) Make sure to select &amp;lsquo;Realistic&amp;rsquo; world type when creating a world. Server operations will use RTG in the server.properties file. For single-player, I also recommend enabling cheats &amp;ndash; just in case &amp;ndash; but if you&amp;rsquo;re the kind that&amp;rsquo;s susceptible to temptation, you can leave it off.</description>

      <description>Alternate Terrain Generator (ATG) or Biomes O&amp;rsquo; Plenty (BoP) When starting a new world, you have a couple of world type options &amp;ndash; either Biomes O&amp;rsquo; Plenty or ATG-Alternate Terrain Generator. I highly recommend changing your world type to ATG &amp;ndash; it generates more realistic rolling hills and surface forms, using the BoP biomes. However, on minimal-memory machines, ATG may cause some hiccups during world generation (there are some workarounds, however).</description>
