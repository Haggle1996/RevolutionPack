<p>REVOLUTION|3 is a significant update to the original Revolution; please refer to NEI for recipe changes and don&rsquo;t expect everything to work the same as it did in the original Revolution.</p>

<h2 id="where-can-i-find-ore-x">Where can I find ore X?</h2>

<p>Oregen is significantly different. Generally, ores can be found at most y-levels. Many ores spawn with giant, rare motherlodes and long, thin trace veins that lead to these motherlodes. Some ores generate in vertical pipes. Specifically:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Ore</th>
<th>Location</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Coal</td>
<td>Spawns just near the surface, and up into hills and mountains.  The veins are long and thick, but sparsely filled with ore and often broken up by caves or depressions in the terrain.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Iron</td>
<td>Groups of long narrow veins found about one third of the way down to bedrock. Especially common in snowy or icy areas.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Gold</td>
<td>Groups of long narrow veins found about two thirds of the way down to bedrock.  Most common in temperate hardwood forests, but still very rare.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Redstone</td>
<td>Single vertical veins starting near the surface and extending down about halfway to bedrock.  Most common in desert climates.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Diamond</td>
<td>Short lava-filled tubes extending upward from bedrock with diamonds around the edges.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Lapis Lazuli</td>
<td>Single vertical veins starting near bedrock and extending about halfway to the surface.  Most common under ocean floors.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Emerald</td>
<td>Short sloping tubes filled sparsely with emeralds and a few &hellip; surprises.  Vastly more common under open grassy hills.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Limonite</td>
<td>Use a shovel! Generally at sea-level and a bit lower. More common in rivers and areas that spawn clay or sand.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Copper</td>
<td>Groups of long narrow veins found about one third of the way down to bedrock.  Especially common in jungles.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Tin</td>
<td>Groups of long narrow veins found about halfway down to bedrock.  More frequent in flat grassy plains.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Uranium &amp; Pitchblende</td>
<td>Isolated veins found about two thirds of the way down to bedrock and only sparsely filled with ore.  Unusually common in devastated wastelands.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Lead</td>
<td>Groups of long narrow veins found about one third of the way down to bedrock.  Especially common in jungles.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Silver</td>
<td>Isolated veins found about two thirds of the way down to bedrock.  Unusually common in mountains.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Nickel</td>
<td>Groups of long narrow veins found near bedrock.  Especially common in swamps.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Aluminum</td>
<td>Flat Clouds found near the surface.  Only found in mesa, swamp, and jungle biomes.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Apatite</td>
<td>Spawns in large, rare veins between y-level 56 and 184.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Certus Quartz</td>
<td>Spawns with charged certus quarts in vertical veins between y-level 76 and 52.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Cadmium</td>
<td>Spawns in the cave dimension, moon, and mars.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Indium</td>
<td>Spawns in the cave dimension, moon, and mars.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Fluorite</td>
<td>Spawns in the cave dimension, moon, and mars.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Magnetite</td>
<td>Spawns in the cave dimension, moon, and mars, and occasionally above y-128 in the overworld.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Calcite</td>
<td>Spawns in the cave dimension, moon, and mars.</td>
</tr>

<p>Ore generation in the Enviromine Cave dimension is richer and more vanilla-like, and is intended for use as a mining dimension. There are also secret ways of creating ore.</p>

<h2 id="significant-gameplay-changes">Significant Gameplay Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is a mini-guide built into the modpack. Access your inventory, then click the guide book along the left edge of your inventory window.</li>
<li>Ores generally yield more from a single block; however, each raw ore is of lower quality, requiring more processing. Advanced tiers of processing equipment yield more ore from a given block &ndash; up to two and a half stacks of ingots per block with all advancements!</li>
<li>Ore flowers spawn on the surface, indicating nearby ores (within 30 block radius for naturally-occurring ore flowers - ore flowers may appear when bone mealing the ground; these mean ore is within an 8 block radius, horizontally).</li>
<li>Torches will set fire to nearby blocks and burn out over time.</li>
<li>Sleeping does not advance time (it does recharge your sleep meter).</li>
<li>Water is finite. You will need to take this into account when building machines (such as the steam engine) that require water. There are several mechanisms in the game to create water.</li>
<li>Seasons change approximately every 32 Minecraft days, with a year lasting 128 Minecraft days. Seasons alter the temperature and precipitation of a biome, and affect various machines and crop growth that depend on these factors.</li>
<li>Animals will breed, age, and die on their own, assuming proper food (such as grass) is present in their vicinity.</li>
<li>Naturally-spawning Vanilla and Forestry trees will die off over time, turning into compost and eventually dirt. Dropped saplings will plant themselves.</li>
<li>Food rots over time. This can be overcome by building Eskys and Freezers (storage blocks from and Enviromine that integrate with Cooking for Blockheads).</li>
<li>Only basic seeds drop from breaking grass. You will need to create mutations in AgriCraft to discover all possible food seeds.</li>
<li>Unsupported cave and building rooves will collapse on you. Make sure to support your ceilings! Different materials can stretch different lengths (up to 3 blocks out). Building common engineered structures, such as l-girder shapes, can extend blocks indefinitely.</li>
<li>Crop growth is significantly slower and is affected by season. Be sure to plant early, often, and extensively. Crops generally grow better underground or in greenhouses, and in friendly biomes.</li>
<li>Power consumption and generation has been revamped throughout the pack. Generally, things are more expensive.</li>
<li>Power, item, and fluid transmission has been tiered:
&ndash; Tier 1: Immersive Engineering (max 4096 RF/t)
&ndash; Tier 2: BuildCraft, Logistics Pipes (max 10248 RF/t)
&ndash; Tier 3: Ender IO (max 20496 RF/t)
&ndash; Tier 4: ElectriCraft (power transmission only - unlimited RF/t)</li>
<li>Early game RF power is best provided through either the Rotational Dynamo or the Immersive Engineering waterwheel/windmill.</li>
<li>Spawners aren&rsquo;t moveable intact during the early game; you must research technology to move them or use them for powered spawners.</li>
<li>Many repetetive items are hidden in NEI (e.g., BiblioCraft and Storage Drawers wood variations; Gun Customization modified weapons). Use Creative Tab to access these items.</li>
